const { Pool } = require('pg');

// Pool automatically uses the following environemntal variables to configure itself:
// PGHOST behaves the same as the host connection parameter.
// PGPORT behaves the same as the port connection parameter.
// PGDATABASE behaves the same as the dbname connection parameter.
// PGUSER behaves the same as the user connection parameter.
// PGPASSWORD behaves the same as the password connection parameter. Use of this environment variable is not recommended for security reasons, as some operating systems allow non-root users to see process environment variables via ps; instead consider using the ~/.pgpass file (see Section 31.14).

const pool = new Pool();
module.exports = {
  query: (text, params) => pool.query(text, params),
};
